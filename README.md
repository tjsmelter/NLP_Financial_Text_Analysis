## NLP Financial Text Analysis

Built Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution using spaCy to extract stock, company, and index categories from financial document.

Utilized customer spaCy 'Entity Ruler' and data pipeline to accurately identify stock symbols, company names, and market indexes (e.g., "S&P 500") within unstructured text data.

Optimized NLP model performance by iteratively refining entity patterns, incorporating stock exchange identifiers, and implementing a "stop word" mechanism to reduce false positives.
